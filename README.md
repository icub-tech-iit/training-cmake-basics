‚öôÔ∏è The basics of CMake
======================

### üìñ Primer
For completing this course you need to have installed on your machine:
- [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/)
- Any c++ compiler
- A text editor(an IDE is recommended)

#### Windows(WSL)
:warning: **Disclaimer**: for licenses issues and in order to uniform the instructions respect to the linux procedure this hands-on can be done
on Windows using the [`Windows Subsystem for Linux`(WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Once it has been installed correctly simply follow the [instructions for linux](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/training-cmake-basics/new/master?readme=1#linux).

It may be better to use a text editor to follow the hands on, then I suggest you to see [these instructions](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild#run-graphical-applications-on-wsl) to run graphical applications on WSL.
#### Linux
- Get the c++ compiler, open a terminal and type:
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
- Get `cmake`:
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install cmake
```
- Get `cmake` gui(optional but highly recommended):
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
```
- Get the text editor(optional but highly recommended):
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install geany
```

Actually you can install the whatever text editor you like (e.g. `kate`, `gedit`, `nano`, `vim`, `atom`, `vs-code`). 

### Hands-on

The hands-on consist in the compilation of a simple executable that given 2 numbers (15 and 10), calculate the sum and the differece.
Follow these steps:
1. Open the `CMakeLists.txt` and fill all the TODO sections, following the teacher instructions.
2. Once finished and saved create the build directory: `$ mkdir build`
3. Enter in the build directory: `$ cd build`
4. Configure and generate the makefiles: `$ cmake ..`
5. Compile your program: `$make`
6. Run: `./myExecutable`

The output should be:
```bash
```
